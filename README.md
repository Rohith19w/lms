A foundational web app built with Python and Flask for secure, role-based user management. It features a robust login system, distinct dashboards for 'Admin' and 'Employee' ranks, and uses Flask-SQLAlchemy for a SQLite database. Passwords are securely hashed. Ideal as a minimalist, extendable template.
